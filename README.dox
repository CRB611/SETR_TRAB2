@brief This is our second assignment for our "Sistemas Embutidos e de Tempo Real" course, whit the intention of aquainting us with unit testing,
we were asked to make a module that is responsible for conecting three sensors (Temperature, Humidity and C0<sub>2</sub>) to a device using UART transmission.
This communication is made in ASCII and each command consists of:
<ul>
    <li><b>'#':</b> A char representing the start of the frame; </li>
    <li><b>'!':</b> A char representing the end of the frame; </li>
    <li><b>A command:</b> A char representing the command, 'T' for Temperature, 'H' for Humidity and 'C' for C0<sub>2</sub>; </li>
    <li><b>Data:</b> Additional data, if required; </li>
    <li><b>The checksum:</b> The sum of the numerical value of the command and the data bytes, the number is sent in three chars. </li>
</ul>

In this project we were also asked to emulate the UART connection.

@details 
<b>Features</b><br>
<ul>
    <li><i>Initialization:</i> Initializing the whole module and simulation. </li>
    <li><i>Command Processing: </i> The possible commands are all correctly processed. </li>
    <li><i>Buffer Management:</i> Various functions to add, get or read data from the buffers.</li>
    <li><i>Collection of data from sensors:</i> Functions to aquire the sensor data. </li>
    <li><i>Number to character conversions, and vice-versa:</i> The integer to char and char to integer conversion is guaranteed. </li>
    <li><i>UART and Sensor Emulation functions:</i> Functions to assure a correct UART and sensor emulation. </li>
    <li><i>UNITY Testing:</i> A total of 17 tests are done using the UNITY engine. </li>
</ul>

<b>File Structure:</b><br>
<ul>
    <li><b><u>src</u></b> Folder where the module and main files are:
        <ul>
            <li><i>cmdproc.c:</i> Source file containing the implementation of the code needed for the module; </li>
            <li><i>cmdproc.h:</i> Header file containing the functions, structures and macros needed for the module; </li>
            <li><i>main.c:</i> Main file, where the tests and the module come together. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b><u>tests</u></b> Folder where the test files are:
        <ul>
            <li><i>test.c:</i> Source file containing the implementation of the tests using UNITY; </li>
            <li><i>test.h:</i> Header file containing the functions, structures and macros needed for the UNITY tests; </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
     <li><b><u>build</u></b> Folder where the .o files are generated to.</li>
     <li><b><u>unity</u></b> Folder where the files required to use UNITY are stored.</li>
     <li><i>makefile</i> The makefile that allows us to run the code.</li>
</ul>


<b>Usage:</b><br>
To use this module run the make command on the main folder, this will generate the .o files in the build directory and the main executable on the base directory.
After the main executable is generated run ./main to execute.

<b>Test scenarios covered:</b><br>
A total of 17 tests are done, these tests cover the following areas:
<ul>
    <li><i>Initialization:</i> Initialization of the module.</li>
    <li><i>Command processing:</i> Each command is tested, including occurences where a wrong command or data is sent</li>
    <li><i>Checksum:</i> The checksum is tested.</li>
    <li><i>Convertion:</i> The ASCII to int and int to ASCII conversions are also tested.</li>
    <li><i>Buffers:</i> Buffer processes like adding elements and geting data are tested.</li>
    <li><i>Sensor Data:</i> The functions to get the data from the sensors are tested, as well as the ocasions where unaccepted data is aquired.</li>
</ul>
